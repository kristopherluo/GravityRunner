Selected Game Implementations:
- Start/Finish Screens: Implemented a start screen/main menu that appears when the game is first run. It displays the key to start the game (space), the key to view the credits (c), the key to view the instructions (i), and the key to exit the game (e). We also implemented a finish/game over screen. It displays "GAME OVER" in large red letters, the key to restart the game (r), the key to return to the main menu (m), and the key to exit the game (e).
- In-Play UI: Implemented a pause menu that can be pulled up in-game by pressing P. It displays the key to un-pause the game (p), the key to return to the main menu (m), and the key to exit the game (e). The score that counts up the longer the player survives, is also displayed in-game at the top left corner.
- Add Textual Items with Fonts: Used the Ethnocentric True Type Font within the game. It can be seen in the main/start menu, credits screen, instructions screen, pause menu, and game over screen.
